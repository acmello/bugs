Here I am sharing the bugs that got it for me, along the past year (2017) which also ranked me at 7 in google HOF, anyway, there is nothing special about them, but folks wanted to see them.

1) google.com/adsense/ DOM XSS: 
i was getting around the app, and I had just noticed this url https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/pub-444/home?host-callback-url=domain.com
nobody would have missed it, 100 percent of hunters would try his bullet in host-callback-url paramter, so did I, and got the XSS fired .
full XSS url was as follow :  https://www.google.com/adsense/new/u/pub-444/home?host-callback-url=javascript:alert(0)
video poc: <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH3J2DXDYZM> google.com/adsense/ XSS
 </a> 

2) business.google.com Stored XSS 

if you ever hunt in business.google.com yo
